    "methods": "The study employed a computational cognitive model called the Coherency Driven Choice (CDC) model to simulate how subjective preferences are formed and modified over time. The model represents choice options and preferences in a shared, continuous, multidimensional space. It uses an error-driven learning process to update preferences to align with past choices, increasing the likelihood of repeating those choices. In Experiment 1, participants designed a toy robot and were then introduced to a second robot. Both robots revealed patterns on their backs, and participants were asked to choose their preferred pattern. The study hypothesized that participants would prefer patterns associated with their designed robot, demonstrating preference formation through choice-induced learning. The CDC model was simulated in a controlled environment to illustrate how preferences evolve through repeated choices.",

During the pattern revelation stage, both designs turned to reveal a chosen unique pattern, a shared pattern, and a non-chosen pattern. Participants performed a preference ranking task, which resulted in an increased preference for the chosen unique pattern. This increased preference subsequently led to a generalization of preference, indicating a broader application of the preference for novel patterns."

During the pattern revelation stage, both designs turned to reveal a chosen unique pattern, a shared pattern, and a non-chosen pattern. Participants then performed a preference ranking task, which resulted in an increased preference for the chosen unique pattern. This increased preference subsequently led to a generalization of preference, suggesting that participants developed a broader application of their preference for the unique pattern."
