    "methods": "The study introduces the Coherency Driven Choice (CDC) model, a computational cognitive model that represents preferences and choices in a shared, continuous, multidimensional space. The model updates preferences based on past choices to maintain coherence between them. This error-driven learning model increases the likelihood of repeating past and similar choices by aligning preferences with previous decisions. In Experiment 1, participants designed a toy robot and then chose between patterns associated with their design, demonstrating preference formation in a controlled setting. The model was validated through simulations and a large-scale experiment, showing that participants adjusted their preferences to align with past choices, even in domains with strong pre-existing preferences, such as political beliefs.",
