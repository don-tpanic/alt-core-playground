    "methods": "The study utilized a computational cognitive model called the Coherency Driven Choice (CDC) model to investigate how decisions influence subjective preferences. The CDC model represents choices and preferences in a continuous, multidimensional space and uses an error-driven learning process to update preferences based on past choices, aligning them to maximize coherency. The model was validated through a simulation where it was shown to develop strong preferences over time by making repeated choices. Additionally, a large-scale human experiment was conducted where participants' preferences were observed to change following a free choice, supporting the model's predictions.",

The chosen robot had a distinct pattern, which was also present on a non-chosen robot. Participants showed a strong preference for the unique pattern on the robot they selected. Furthermore, they preferred the shared pattern more than the unique pattern on the non-chosen robot. This pattern of preference suggests that participants were using discriminative learning by associating the patterns with their choices.",

The robot that participants chose featured a unique pattern, which was also present on a non-chosen robot.

The robot that was chosen shared a pattern with a non-chosen robot, while each robot also had unique patterns. Participants expressed a preference for the pattern shared between the chosen and non-chosen robots over the unique pattern on the non-chosen robot. This preference demonstrated that participants were engaging in discriminative learning by associating these patterns with their choices.",

Each non-chosen robot possessed a unique pattern, which was shared with the chosen robot. Participants demonstrated a clear preference for the unique pattern on the non-chosen robot. They also showed a higher preference for the shared pattern compared to the unique pattern on the chosen robot. This preference pattern indicated that participants were engaging in discriminative learning by associating the patterns with their choices.",

Each robot, both chosen and non-chosen, featured unique patterns. The chosen robot had a unique pattern that was also present on the non-chosen robot, while the non-chosen robot had its own unique pattern. Participants expressed a preference for the shared pattern found on both the chosen and non-chosen robots. They showed a greater preference for this shared pattern over the unique pattern on the non-chosen robot. This pattern of preference suggests that participants were engaging in discriminative learning by associating patterns with their choices.",

Each non-chosen robot featured a unique pattern and shared a pattern with the chosen robot. Participants exhibited a preference for the unique pattern on the non-chosen robot over the shared pattern, and they showed the least preference for the unique pattern on the chosen robot. This pattern of preference demonstrated that participants were engaging in discriminative learning by associating patterns with their decisions."
