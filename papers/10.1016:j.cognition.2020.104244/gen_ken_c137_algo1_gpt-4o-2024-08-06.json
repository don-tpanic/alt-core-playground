    "methods": "The study employed a computational cognitive model called the Coherency Driven Choice (CDC) model to simulate how subjective preferences evolve over time. The CDC model posits that preferences and choices are represented within a shared, continuous, multidimensional space. The model updates preferences based on past choices using an error-driven learning approach, which seeks to maximize coherency between past choices and current preferences. In Experiment 1, human participants designed a toy robot and were subsequently asked to choose between novel patterns associated with the robot they designed or rejected. In Experiment 2, participants voted for political candidates based on trivial characteristics, and their agreement with the candidate's later-revealed controversial opinions was assessed. The study aimed to validate the CDC model's predictions by observing preference changes in controlled experimental settings.",
