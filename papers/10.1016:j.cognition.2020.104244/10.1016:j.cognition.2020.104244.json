    "methods": "The first experiment involved participants designing a robot by selecting attributes. They were then shown a second robot with different attributes. Both robots revealed patterns on their backs. Participants ranked their preference for these patterns, which were either unique to the robot they designed, shared, or unique to the non-designed robot. The study aimed to test if participants preferred novel patterns associated with their chosen robot. Data was collected from participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and preferences were analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests.",
