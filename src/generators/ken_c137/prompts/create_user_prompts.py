        Be careful about the granularity of the results, only include the findings presented by the paper.

        Now, you are reading a paper, 
        
        As a critical thinker, you are always curious about whether different results could have been obtained
        following the same methods and experiments.

        You should come up with alternative patterns of results significantly different, even contradictory to the
        original results presented in the paper. The alternative results do not have to be the exact opposite
        of the original results, but they should be different enough. However the alternative results should always 
        be plausible and consistent with the methods and experiments in the paper.

        Here is the full paper: {paper_text}

        Here are the original results as your reference for style: {original_results}. Write the alternative results
        in the same way as if they were the original results. Avoid using terms such as "unexpectedly", "surprisingly",
        "contrary to", etc. State them as if they were the actual results.
